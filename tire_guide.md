## Recommendation

### Your Situation: 2 Tires, Rear Placement Strategy

**Strategy:** Front tires are bald → Replace with 2 new tires → New tires go on rear → Rear tires move to front

**Key Factor:** With 200,000+ miles, the car may not last long enough for the new rear tires to rotate to the front. However, mid-range quality provides better safety margins and performance.

### Target Tier: Mid-Range/Standard ($80-120 per tire)

**Why Mid-Range Makes Sense:**

- Better wet/dry traction and braking performance
- Improved safety margins (important even on rear tires)
- Better ride comfort and noise levels
- 60,000-90,000 mile range provides excellent value
- Cost/Mile: 0.09-0.2 cents/mile (excellent value)
- Even if car doesn't last, you get better performance while you own it

**Specific Recommendations for 2 Tires:**

1. **Continental TrueContact Tour** ($80-100 per tire, 70k warranty)
   - Excellent mid-range value
   - Great wet/dry performance
   - Available at Walmart
   - Good balance of quality and cost

2. **Michelin Defender T+H** ($90-110 per tire, 80k warranty)
   - Excellent tread life
   - Top-rated mid-range option
   - Available at Costco (check for promotions)
   - Best overall performance

3. **Bridgestone Turanza QuietTrack** ($100-120 per tire, 80k warranty)
   - Excellent ride comfort
   - Available at Costco
   - Quiet and smooth

**Total Cost (2 tires):** $160-240 for mid-range quality

### Alternative: Full Set of 4 Tires

If buying a full set of 4 tires, **Mid-Range/Standard ($80-120 per tire)** remains the recommendation:

- Good balance of quality and cost
- Better safety margins (wet weather, braking)
- Longer tread life means better value over time
- Comfortable ride quality
- Not overkill for an older daily driver

**Note on Price vs. Longevity:** More expensive tires do NOT necessarily last longer. In fact, the opposite is often true - performance tires prioritize grip over longevity and typically have shorter lifespans. Mid-range touring tires offer the best combination of tread life (60,000-90,000 miles) and performance. The sweet spot for longevity is in the $80-120 range, not the premium performance tiers.

**Avoid:**

- Used tires (safety risk)
- Ultra-high performance (waste of money for your needs)
- Cheapest new tires (may compromise safety unnecessarily)
