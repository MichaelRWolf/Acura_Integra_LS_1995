# Power Steering Pump Replacement - 1995 Acura Integra LS

## Safety Precautions

- Disconnect battery negative terminal before starting
- Allow engine to cool completely
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Have catch pan ready for fluid spills
- Wear safety glasses and gloves
- Support vehicle properly if lifting

## Tools Required

- Socket set (10mm, 12mm, 14mm, 17mm, 19mm)
- Wrench set
- Screwdrivers (flat and Phillips)
- Power steering pulley puller tool
- Power steering pulley installer tool
- Fluid catch pan
- Funnel
- Shop towels
- Jack and jack stands (if needed)
- Torque wrench

## Parts Required

- New or rebuilt power steering pump
- Power steering fluid (Honda/Acura PSF or equivalent)
- O-rings for fittings (if not included with pump)
- Power steering belt (if worn or damaged)

## Belt Configuration

**Important:** On the 1995 Acura Integra LS, the power steering belt and alternator belt are **separate belts**:
- **Power steering belt:** Connects crankshaft pulley to power steering pump (separate belt)
- **Alternator belt:** Connects crankshaft pulley to alternator (separate belt)

The power steering pump is typically mounted on an adjustable bracket that allows tension adjustment. You may need to remove the alternator belt first to access the power steering belt, depending on routing, but the belts themselves are independent systems.

## Preparation

1. Park vehicle on level surface
2. Engage parking brake
3. Disconnect negative battery terminal
4. Allow engine to cool completely
5. Gather all tools and parts
6. Position catch pan under power steering area

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Remove Power Steering Belt

1. Locate power steering pump pulley on front of engine
2. Identify belt routing (note direction for reinstallation)
3. Locate power steering pump adjustment mechanism (pump may be on adjustable bracket with pivot/adjustment bolts)
4. Loosen power steering pump adjustment bolt (typically on bracket)
5. Loosen power steering pump pivot bolt (if present)
6. Push pump toward engine to release belt tension
7. Slip belt off power steering pump pulley
8. Remove belt completely
9. **Note:** Power steering belt and alternator belt are separate - you may need to remove alternator belt first to access power steering belt depending on routing

### Step 2: Drain Power Steering Fluid

1. Locate power steering reservoir (typically on passenger side)
2. Remove reservoir cap
3. Use turkey baster or pump to remove fluid from reservoir
4. Place catch pan under power steering pump
5. Disconnect return line (low pressure line) from pump
6. Allow fluid to drain into catch pan
7. Cap or plug return line to prevent contamination

### Step 3: Disconnect Power Steering Lines

1. Locate high-pressure line connection on pump
2. Place catch pan under connection
3. Use appropriate wrench to disconnect high-pressure line
4. Expect some fluid spillage - have towels ready
5. Cap or plug high-pressure line fitting
6. Disconnect any other lines connected to pump

### Step 4: Remove Power Steering Pump Mounting Bolts

1. Locate pump mounting bolts (typically 2-3 bolts)
2. Common sizes: 12mm, 14mm, or 17mm
3. Remove bolts in sequence (note positions if different lengths)
4. Support pump weight while removing last bolt
5. Keep bolts organized for reinstallation

### Step 5: Remove Power Steering Pump

1. Carefully pull pump away from engine
2. May require slight rotation or tilting to clear obstructions
3. Watch for any remaining fluid in pump
4. Set pump aside on clean surface

### Step 6: Transfer Components to New Pump

1. Remove pulley from old pump using pulley puller tool
2. Clean pulley thoroughly
3. Inspect pulley for damage or wear
4. Install pulley on new pump using pulley installer tool
5. Ensure pulley is fully seated and aligned
6. Transfer any brackets or mounting hardware if needed

### Step 7: Install New Power Steering Pump

1. Position new pump in mounting location
2. Align pump with mounting holes
3. Install mounting bolts hand-tight first
4. Tighten bolts to specification (typically 30-40 ft-lbs)
5. Use torque wrench for final tightening
6. Verify pump is secure and properly aligned

### Step 8: Reconnect Power Steering Lines

1. Remove caps/plugs from line fittings
2. Install new O-rings on fittings (if provided)
3. Connect high-pressure line to pump
4. Tighten fitting securely (typically 25-30 ft-lbs)
5. Connect return line to pump
6. Verify all connections are tight

### Step 9: Install Power Steering Belt

1. Route belt according to original configuration
2. Slip belt over power steering pump pulley and crankshaft pulley
3. Loosen power steering pump adjustment bolt (on pump bracket)
4. Pull power steering pump away from engine to create belt tension
5. Verify belt is properly seated on all pulleys
6. Tighten power steering pump pivot bolt (if present)
7. Tighten power steering pump adjustment bolt
8. Check belt tension (should have 1/2 inch deflection at midpoint between pulleys)
9. **Note:** Power steering belt is separate from alternator belt - ensure correct belt is installed

### Step 10: Fill Power Steering System

1. Fill reservoir with power steering fluid
2. Use Honda/Acura PSF or equivalent
3. Fill to "MAX" line on reservoir
4. Do not overfill

### Step 11: Bleed Power Steering System

1. Reconnect negative battery terminal
2. Start engine
3. Turn steering wheel lock-to-lock slowly (full left to full right)
4. Repeat 3-5 times
5. Check fluid level - add if needed
6. Continue turning wheel until no air bubbles appear in reservoir
7. Check for leaks at all connections

### Step 12: Final Inspection

1. Check all mounting bolts are tight
2. Verify all line connections are secure
3. Check belt tension and alignment
4. Inspect for fluid leaks
5. Verify steering operates smoothly
6. Check fluid level one final time
7. Test drive vehicle to verify operation

## Torque Specifications

- Power steering pump mounting bolts: 30-40 ft-lbs
- Power steering pump adjustment bolt: 15-20 ft-lbs (on bracket)
- Power steering pump pivot bolt: 30-40 ft-lbs (if present)
- High-pressure line fitting: 25-30 ft-lbs
- **Note:** Alternator belt is separate - if you remove alternator belt for access, alternator pivot bolt: 30-40 ft-lbs, alternator adjustment bolt: 15-20 ft-lbs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Belt Squealing After Installation

- Check belt tension - may be too loose
- Verify belt routing is correct
- Check for belt contamination (oil, fluid)
- Inspect pulley alignment

### Issue: Steering Feels Heavy or Stiff

- Air still in system - continue bleeding procedure
- Check fluid level
- Verify pump is functioning properly
- Check for restrictions in lines

### Issue: Fluid Leaks

- Verify all connections are tight
- Check O-rings are properly installed
- Inspect lines for damage
- Check reservoir cap is secure

### Issue: Pump Noise

- Normal for new pump to be slightly noisy initially
- Should quiet down after break-in period
- If excessive noise persists, verify proper installation
- Check for air in system

## Post-Installation Maintenance

1. Check fluid level after first 50 miles
2. Check fluid level after first 500 miles
3. Inspect for leaks periodically
4. Check belt condition and tension monthly
5. Replace fluid every 30,000-50,000 miles

## Notes

- Power steering fluid is flammable - dispose of properly
- Old pump may be rebuildable - consider keeping for core exchange
- Save old O-rings to match sizes if replacements needed
- Document any variations from standard procedure for future reference
